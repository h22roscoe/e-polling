          This graph gives a metric for how supported an argument is
          taking into account all of the other arguments which may affect it
          (i.e. it takes into account votes on supporters,
          supporters of supporters, attackers, attackers of attackers, etc.).
          A high score, also denoted as σ, corresponds to the argument having
          more total support.

        <canvas id="tauScore" width="40" height="40"></canvas>
        <p>
          This graph shows how many people voted for the direct supporters
          and attackers of each argument. A high base score, also denoted
          as τ, corresponds to more direct supporters being voted for
          than direct attackers.

      <h1>Argument tree</h1>
      <p>
        This graph shows the connections between arguments in the poll.
        These relationships are used in our algorithmm to calculate a node's
        score. This score is represented here as the radius and the greater
        the radius, the greater the score of the argument. The opacity is based
        on the base scores defined above.
